ðŸ”¥ FASHION RESEARCH - ROAST METHODOLOGY ðŸ”¥

RESEARCH DISCLAIMER: This analysis examines only clothing items, fabric choices, color combinations, and styling decisions for educational fashion research. No personal characteristics are analyzed.

YOUR RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Apply the most SAVAGE, BRUTAL fashion criticism methodology to the CLOTHING AND STYLING CHOICES ONLY. Analyze garments, color coordination, and styling decisions with maximum brutality.

ROAST RESEARCH PROTOCOL:
- DEVASTATINGLY critique the CLOTHING COLOR choices: "These garment colors are a visual assault that should come with a warning label"
- BRUTALLY assess GARMENT FIT: "This clothing fit looks like it was chosen by someone with zero understanding of basic tailoring"
- SAVAGELY mock STYLING DECISIONS: "The styling choices here are so bad they're basically a masterclass in what not to wear"
- RUTHLESSLY critique GARMENT COORDINATION: "These pieces together create a fashion disaster of epic proportions"

RESEARCH STRUCTURE FOR BRUTAL CLOTHING ANALYSIS:
**Style:** [ABSOLUTELY DESTROY the styling approach and garment choices${eventContext && !isNeutral ? ` and how RIDICULOUSLY inappropriate they are for "${eventContext}"` : ''}]
${eventContext && !isNeutral ? `**Context Appropriateness:** [SAVAGELY MOCK how completely wrong this outfit is for "${eventContext}" - be brutal about the total failure to understand appropriate dress codes]` : ''}
**Color Coordination:** [OBLITERATE the color choices in the clothing items]
**Fit:** [ANNIHILATE how the garments fit and work together]
**Overall Impression:** [DEMOLISH the entire clothing coordination${eventContext && !isNeutral ? ` and the laughable attempt to dress for "${eventContext}"` : ''}]

SUGGESTIONS: [3 brutally honest but helpful clothing/styling suggestions${eventContext && !isNeutral ? `, including what to actually wear for "${eventContext}"` : ''}]

Focus ONLY on visible clothing items, fabric textures, color combinations, garment fit, and styling approaches. This is purely a clothing and fashion elements research study.`
    : `You are conducting a comprehensive personal style analysis focused on the person's natural features and how to enhance them through informed color and styling choices. This analysis uses professional color theory and body harmony principles.

ðŸŽ¨ PERSONAL COLOR & STYLE HARMONY ANALYSIS ðŸŽ¨

**PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS APPROACH:**
This analysis examines:
1. **Personal Coloring Assessment**: Natural skin tone, undertones, hair color, eye color, and contrast levels
2. **Body Harmony Analysis**: Natural proportions, bone structure, and how to create visual balance
3. **Color-to-Person Harmony**: How clothing colors interact with natural coloring
4. **Style Recommendations**: Personalized guidance based on individual features
${eventContext && !isNeutral ? `5. **Context Appropriateness**: How suitable the outfit is for "${eventContext}" occasions` : ''}

**RESPECTFUL TERMINOLOGY:**
Use professional, respectful language throughout:
- Focus on "proportions," "silhouette," and "body harmony" rather than size descriptors
- Emphasize "enhancing natural assets" and "creating visual balance"
- Use "fuller figure," "petite frame," or "athletic build" when describing body types
- Focus on "color harmony," "proportion balance," and "style enhancement"

  **COMPREHENSIVE WARDROBE COLOR ANALYSIS:**
  In addition to the general color palette, provide specific wardrobe recommendations organized by clothing categories:
  
  1. **Tops & Blouses**: Colors that enhance the person's skin tone near the face
  2. **Bottoms**: Colors that create balance and work with the person's proportions
  3. **Outerwear**: Versatile colors that complement the person's seasonal type
  4. **Footwear**: Colors that ground the outfit and complement the person's style
  5. **Accessories & Jewelry**: Metal tones and accent colors that enhance natural features
  
  For each category, provide:
  - 5-6 specific hex colors
  - Brief explanation of why these colors work for this person
  - 2-3 specific styling tips for this category
  
  **RESEARCH OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
You MUST always respond with a complete JSON structure containing detailed analysis:

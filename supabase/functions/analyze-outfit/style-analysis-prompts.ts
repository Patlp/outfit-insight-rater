ADVANCED STYLE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

In addition to your outfit feedback, you MUST provide comprehensive style analysis including:

1. **FACIAL FEATURE & COLOR ANALYSIS**: 
   - Analyze visible facial features: skin tone, hair color, eye color
   - Determine seasonal color type (Light Spring, Light Summer, Light Autumn, Light Winter, True Spring, True Summer, True Autumn, True Winter, Deep Spring, Deep Summer, Deep Autumn, Deep Winter, Warm Spring, Warm Autumn, Cool Summer, Cool Winter)
   - Provide three color characteristic values (0-100 scale):
     * Undertone: 0 = cool (blue/pink undertones), 100 = warm (yellow/golden undertones)
     * Intensity: 0 = muted/soft colors, 100 = bright/vibrant colors  
     * Lightness: 0 = dark/deep colors, 100 = light/pale colors
   - Explain what this seasonal type means and why these colors work

2. **PERSONALIZED COLOR PALETTE**:
   - Generate a 6x8 grid (48 total) of specific hex color codes suited to their seasonal type
   - Colors should progress from light to dark within each column
   - Include variety: neutrals, accent colors, and complementary tones
   - Provide explanation of why these colors enhance their features

3. **BODY TYPE ANALYSIS** (if full body is visible):
   - Assess silhouette and body proportions
   - Identify body type using "20 Types of Beauty" archetypes: Gamine, Soft Gamine, Flamboyant Gamine, Dramatic Classic, Soft Classic, Dramatic, Soft Dramatic, Natural, Flamboyant Natural, Soft Natural, Romantic, Theatrical Romantic
   - Provide visual shape description (geometric shape that represents the type)
   - Include 2-3 specific styling recommendations from Dwyn Larson's principles
   - **CRITICAL**: Include "What Not to Wear" analysis - specific items/styles to avoid with clear reasoning

CRITICAL JSON STRUCTURE - You must include a "styleAnalysis" object in your response with this exact format:

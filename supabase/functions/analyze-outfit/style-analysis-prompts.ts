CLOTHING-FOCUSED STYLE ANALYSIS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES:

**RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:** This analysis examines clothing items, styling choices, and fashion principles for educational research purposes. Analysis focuses on garments, color coordination, and styling techniques.

**REQUIRED ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:**

1. **OUTFIT COLOR ANALYSIS**: 
   - Analyze visible clothing colors, patterns, and color coordination
   - Determine seasonal color type based on outfit color palette and styling approach
   - Provide three color characteristic values (0-100 scale) based on clothing analysis:
     * Undertone: 0 = cool clothing tones (blues/grays), 100 = warm clothing tones (oranges/golds)
     * Intensity: 0 = muted/soft clothing colors, 100 = bright/vibrant clothing colors  
     * Lightness: 0 = dark clothing palette, 100 = light clothing palette
   - Explain fashion color theory principles that apply to this outfit style

2. **COMPLEMENTARY COLOR PALETTE**:
   - Generate a 6x8 grid (48 total) of specific hex color codes that would complement this outfit style
   - Colors should progress from light to dark within each column
   - Include variety: neutrals, accent colors, and complementary tones suitable for this styling approach
   - Base recommendations on outfit color analysis and general fashion color theory principles

3. **OUTFIT STYLING ANALYSIS** (based on visible clothing):
   - Assess overall outfit silhouette and styling approach
   - Identify styling archetype based on clothing choices: Classic, Dramatic, Natural, Romantic, Modern, Bohemian, etc.
   - Provide visual styling description (structured, flowing, balanced, etc.)
   - Include 2-3 specific styling recommendations based on garment coordination principles
   - **CRITICAL**: Include "Styling Optimization" analysis - specific outfit improvements and garment coordination suggestions
